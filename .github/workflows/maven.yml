# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Maven verify

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  [push]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      #STEP 1
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # STEP 2
      # Actions repository : https://github.com/actions/setup-java
      # We can also found this action in the MarketPlace : https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-java
      - name: Set up JDK 11
        uses: actions/setup-java@v1
        with: # We pass an argument to the Github actions "setup-java" (see README of repository setup-java for more information)
          java-version: 11
          
      # STEP pre-3-1
      - run: 'echo "$WSDL" > WSDL_login.txt'
        shell: bash
        env:
          WSDL: ${{secrets.WSDL_LOGIN}}
          
      # STEP pre-3-2
      - run: 'echo "$API" > API_password.txt'
        shell: bash
        env:
          API: ${{secrets.API_PASSWORD}}
          
      # STEP 3
      # We don't use a specific action but just a command which will be run on Ubuntu
      - name: Verify maven
        run: mvn -B test --file pom.xml
